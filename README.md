# Brief / Scope of Project
Goal: Create a game of Blackjack in Java. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic.

# What I did
I wrote a set of Java classes, covering:
- Runner
- Game
- Deck of cards
- Player
- Hand of cards
- Card
- Card attributes (suit, rank)
- Various tests

# Tools I used
Java
Android Studio
Mockito

# Result
I made a game of Blackjack which could be run in the terminal. It allowed both human and bot players, deterministic or random decks of cards, normal or marked cards, and actions in Blackjack including (where allowed) Hit, Stand, Double, Split.
