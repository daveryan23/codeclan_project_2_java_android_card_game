# Brief / Scope of Project
Goal: Create a game of Blackjack in Android IDE and Java language. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic, in either Terminal or Android IDE.

# What I did
I wrote a set of Java classes, covering:
- Runner
- Game
- Deck of cards
- Player
- Hand of cards
- Card
- Card attributes (suit, rank)
- Various tests

I also wrote some demo activities for Android.

# Tools I used
Java
Android Studio
Mockito

# Result
I made a game of Blackjack which could be run in the terminal. It allowed both human and bot players, deterministic or random decks of cards, normal or marked cards, and actions in Blackjack including (where allowed) Hit, Stand, Double, Split.

I also made a demo in Android of shuffling and displaying a Deck of 52 cards, with the test set of 8 cards (2 marked) added in.
