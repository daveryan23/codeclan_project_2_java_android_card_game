# DO THE CARD GAME!!

# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## Card game

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

We recommend something reasonably straight forward like BlackJack. The logic for your app will be in Java classes and you can use the methods in these classes in Android activites to create a UI.

***HINT*** Think of the lessons where we wrote regular Java classes in Android Studio, ran unit tests on them, and then used them in our Eight Ball app.

### MVP
The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

```
  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!
```

### Project Extensions

* Possibly add another card game
* Improve the UI

## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt about a library you want to use ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.

## UX

## Before you begin

Before you begin coding, consider stopping for a minute and think about the user of your product.

Ask yourself the following questions:

* What user needs is your app going to answer? Can you document that?
* Why would your users want to use this over something similar that they've seen elsewhere?
* How could you make sure that your app uses interface solutions that users are familiar with?
* What is the user journey — how will users interact with your app, and how many steps will be necessary to complete their goals?

1. Use this [user needs template](https://goo.gl/zHbfud) to document things that people may want from your app
2. Download and print out the [template for the user journey](https://goo.gl/zXkgtZ) — use it to map steps of the journey. Remember about user actions and system responses. What's required for every particular screen?

If your project has an user-facing interface, make sure to prepare a simple sketch of the app (or a wireframe with UXPin if you wish), sketching out all major steps of the user journey you've identified. Think of potential problems and ways of addressing these in a way that makes the user experience smooth and pleasant.

If your project doesn't have an end-interface, simply document user needs and user journeys (if you can). Try approaching the problem logically — how many steps will complete the user's task?

## After you sketch your application out

Show it to your colleague and ask them how does it come across to them. Don't guide them; give them a goal to complete and listen as they describe their way through your sketches. Can you think of anything that could be improved? If so, sketch quickly and test with the same colleague. See if they think it got any better.

Only then write your code — don't spend time building something that isn't focused on user needs.

### After you're done

* Show your application to a couple of colleagues. Can they use it? Is there anything that could be quickly changed to make it more user-friendly?
